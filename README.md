## About Me

**Ex-Software Engineering Intern @ Zipline | DevOps & Cloud Data Engineer | MS CS @ Cal State LA**

I build systems that don't break, fix slow pipelines, and turn manual work into simple automation. With **2+ years of experience** in cloud and DevOps systems, I focus on:

- Building automation and monitoring tools that reduce failures and manual work
- Designing AWS data pipelines, CI/CD workflows, and production systems
- Working with Python, SQL, AWS, Docker, Terraform, and CI/CD tools
- Writing clean code for stable deployments with clear results

**Currently:** Pursuing MS in Computer Science at Cal State LA | Research Assistant | Teaching Assistant (OS & Data Science)

**Seeking:** New Grad Software Engineering, DevOps, and Cloud Data Engineering roles (Summer 2026)
